## Reaction-Based Quick Logging

### How It Works
1. Use any AI analysis command (`!analyzeimage`, `!analyzefood`, `!estimate`)
2. Bot provides calorie estimate with ‚úÖ and ‚ùå reactions
3. Click ‚úÖ to automatically add calories to your daily total
4. Click ‚ùå to decline (analysis is ignored)
5. Get instant confirmation with updated daily total

### Benefits
- **No manual typing** - just react to add calories
- **Prevents duplicate entries** - one reaction = one log entry
- **Instant feedback** - see your daily total immediately
- **Error prevention** - confirmation messages prevent mistakes

## Data Persistence

### Storage System
- **JSON file storage** (`user_calories.json`)
- **Per-user tracking** - each Discord user has separate data
- **Daily organization** - calories organized by date
- **Automatic backup** - data saved after each entry

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "user_id": {
    "2025-06-04": {
      "total_calories": 1247,
      "foods": [
